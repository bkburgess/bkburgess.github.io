        <h1>Bryce Burgess</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! If you're here, it's probably to get a sense of who I am as a programmer, and what I can do. You can probably guess my name. <br><br>
            I've been programming in Python for several years now, but also have experience in a number of other languages: SQL, Java, Matlab, C, and more recently, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. <br><br>
            My educational background is in Applied Physics, where I learned to appreciate how the balancing of different effects leads to an observed outcome, and want to explore more in understanding complex systems. Hence, Simulations and Data analysis are two of my major programming interests.
