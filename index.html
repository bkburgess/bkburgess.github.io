                Hello! I presume you're here to get a sense of who I am as a programmer, and what I've done in my own time. You can probably guess my name. <br><br>
                I've been programming in Python for several years now, but also have experience in a number of other languages: SQL, Java, Matlab, C, and more recently, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. <br><br>
                My Bachelor's Degree is in Applied Physics, where I learned to appreciate how the balancing of different effects leads to an observed outcome, and want to explore more in understanding complex systems. Hence, Simulations and Data analysis are two of my major programming interests. 
            </p>

                        The above plot is an example of what it looks like. The red curve is the true line that it's trying to search, and so is unknown to the actual algorithm.
                        The compound blue curve is the acquisition function that it uses to determine where to search next, and the green triangles are the points it has already sampled and adjusted the blue curve to fit.
                        The vertical black line shows where it will make its next guess, determined by the maximum of the acquisition function that isn't already within the samples.

                    <h3>Bayesian Optimization Overview</h3>
                    Bayesian Optimization is a search algorithm for finding the best place to sample for an expensive to calculate function. One of the most common applications for this method is in tuning the hyperparameters of machine learning models such as neural networks.
                    It usually uses a small sample of points to shepherd a collection tens of distinct smooth curves. 
                    Then for each point in the domain, you calculate the variance in the values given by the curves. 
                    Because the curves converge at known points, and tend to spread out in between known points, the algorithm can balance prioritizing its search between exploiting the best values found so far, against the value of exploring new areas to gather more information. 
                    Additionally, this balance can be tuned with a single input parameter.<br>
                    
                    <h3>Exploratory Optimization</h3>
                    The exploratory_opt.py file was inspired by bayesian optimization, but instead of calculating the spread of a collection of smooth function, it just fits any one of several convex functions to pass through each pair of adjacent sampled points.
                    The resulting piecewise function can be used to achieve a similar overall result that balances exploiting the best samples found so far against exploring unknown areas, again tunable with a single parameter.
                    This implementation uses a standin function for the expensive function that it's supposed to be applied to, by composing several sine waves of different amplitudes and frequencies.

                    <h3>Further work to do:</h3>

                        <li>Benchmark the Exploratory Optimization against Bayesian Optimization, boh for time and memory complexity.</li>
                        <li>This method requires having the samples at the outer bounds of the domain space, since it needs to compute a function between two known points. I'd like to find a way to modify it to not need this if possible.</li>
                        <li>This implementation currently only applies to one dimensional data in a discrete domain, and I'd like to expand it to work for n dimensions and for continuous space.</li>
                        <li>It currently outputs a new iteration of the plot, which I would like to change to an animation that is easier to use.</li>
                    </ul> 
                    To run this program, you just need to invoke it from the command line with<br>

                    <h3>PID Overview</h3>
                        PID controllers are widely used in robotics, where they can determine how to get the robot, or a part of a robot to the desired state quickly, efficiently, and stably, even in the face of interference and outside forces. The controller determines how much force to apply in which direction. To do this they consist of essentially three parts:<br>

                        Proportional - this just measures the difference between where the robot is, and where it's trying to get to, and provides a force proportional to that distance. If this were the only component, then the robot would oscillate around the target point with amplitude equal to the initial difference, rather than stay consistently at or near the target.<br>
                        Derivative - this measures how much progress the robot has made in each computation cycle, which helps the robot avoid overshooting or oscillating around the target, by providing a slight damping effect proportional to the progress it's already made.<br>
                        Integrative - this measures how much progress the robot has gone, and is primarily useful for compensating for outside effects like external forces, or changes in the robots mass, which affect the relationship between the robot's force applied and the motion that results. This can sometimes be left out in simpler application<br>

                        Each of these components is multiplied by a tuned gain value to determine the influence that they each have on the force applied.
                    <h3>Further work to do:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The present version is single dimensional, I'd like to expand it to multiple dimensions, preferably an arbitrary number</li>
                        <li>I'd like to turn it into a class that can actually be applied to a larger project</li>
                        <li>Reimplement it in C++ for my own learning</li>
                        <li>Implement one or more methods for automatically tuning the gains</li>
                    </ul> 
                    To run this program, you just need to invoke it from the command line with<br>
                    <div class="code">

                    <h3>SIRD</h3>
                        This repository is a place for me to work on epidemiology simulations, primarily centered on using the SIRD model.

                        SIRD stands for Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, and Dead. The idea is that the population of a a densely populated area will fall into one of these four categories at any given time, and we can use estimates and heuristics to model how the disease progresses over time.

                    This is a project I worked on at TU Berlin, to help the German legislature decide how they might be able to streamline their healthcare system. 
                    I was provided data about individual hospitals, demographic data, and patient healthcare data sourced from health insurance companies in Germany with the goal of estimating what
                    factors most influenced a patients' choice of hospital for elective treatment, to aid in validating a colleague's assumption. In particular, I wanted to know how much impact the 
                    quality of the hospital had on patients' decision, since Germany has a national and publicly available (by website) system for evaluating hospitals based on their quality. Price 
                    and insurance network were nonfactors because of the nature of Germany's healthcare system. <br><br>
                    Ultimately, I found that the single most impactful factor was simply the travel time between the patients' home location and the hospital. <br><br>
                    Note that because I was working with very sensitive personal health information, I am not providing any of the data I was using, nor anything that could expose that information.
